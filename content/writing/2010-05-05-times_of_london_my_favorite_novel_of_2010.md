My favorite novel of 2010 would have been my favorite novel of 1993 — if only I had known about it. At the time, Saul Bellow was not on Twitter but even his lavish quote for Tony & Susan, originally published that year, failed to sell enough copies of the book to keep it in print. So in an unusual eco-feat of arts recycling, Tony & Susan is being republished, giving it a much-deserved second life.
