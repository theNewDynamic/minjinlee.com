PACHINKO was selected by:

**John Boyne**
<br>My favourite novel of the year so far is Pachinko by Min Jin Lee, a multi-generational story of Koreans living in Japan over the last century. Elizabeth Strout’s Anything is Possible is also quite brilliant, a series of interconnected stories revealing the secrets and regrets of the inhabitants of a small town. I’ve been saving Benjamin Black’s Prague Nights for a trip there with my nephew and niece this summer. There’s a lot of buzz about Elizabeth Day’s The Party as well as Sarah Winman’s Tin Man, so both of these will be straight on to my reading list.

**Sinead Crowley**
<br>One of my favorite books of 2017 was Pachinko, by Min Jin Lee, a sweeping Korean family saga which would be perfect to get lost in on holidays. In another strong year for Irish books I particularly loved When Light is like Water by Molly McCluskey. Meanwhile, among the many works of crime fiction I read this year, Let the Dead Speak by Jane Casey and He Said / She Said by Erin Kelly stood out and in non ficton I really enjoyed Gone, by Min Kym.

**Neil Hegarty**
<br>Reading pleasures of the year to date include Min Jin Lee’s evocative immigrant story Pachinko; Tana French’s tense and salty The Trespasser; and A History of Running Away, Paula McGrath’s pugilistic follow-up to Generation. I’m currently munching through Elizabeth Strout’s Anything is Possible, which is next up at my book club. Other eagerly anticipated titles include Between Them, Richard Ford’s slender memoir of his parents; and Colm Tóibín’s new novel House of Names. I was lucky enough to hear both writers read at Listowel Writers’ Week this year, and bring their words brilliantly to life.

**Rick O’Shea**
<br>My idea of a “summer read” doesn’t necessarily meet the general criteria. You have been warned. I’d suggest John Boyne’s wonderful The Heart’s Invisible Furies, Theft By Finding, the David Sedaris diaries, Sally Rooney’s Conversations With Friends or Min Jin Lee’s Korean family saga Pachinko. If you’re travelling after late July then one of the best books of the year is the upcoming Tin Man by Sarah Winman. The one I’m saving for when I go away is a gorgeous reprint I was given recently of Catch-22. I haven’t read it since I was a teenager.
