By Tash Aw

I’d recommend The End of Eddy (Harvill Secker £12.99), Édouard Louis’s sensational autobiographical novel set in northern France, and Pachinko (Head of Zeus £8.99), Min Jin Lee’s sprawling epic of Korean immigrant life in Japan. If you want to keep up with global affairs while sun-tanning, try Howard W French’s lively and illuminating Everything Under the Heavens: How the Past Helps Shape China’s Push for Global Power.

I’m heading to the east coast of Malaysia and have packed Qiu Miaojin’s Notes of a Crocodile (£9.99), recently published in translation by NYRB Classics; Svetlana Alexievich’s Second-Hand Time (Fitzcarraldo £14.99), and Zola’s L’Assommoir(Oxford World’s Classics £8.99).
