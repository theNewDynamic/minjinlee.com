One Korean Family, Four Generations Later

Feb 20, 2017

Min Jin Lee joins us to discuss her new novel Pachinko, which traces four generations of a Korean family. Lee recounts the origins of the Korean diaspora, beginning with Japan’s annexation of Korea in 1910. The story begins in the village in Busan with a fisherman and his wife and the birth of their son, and follows their descendants who live as ethnic Koreans in Japan.

Min Jin Lee will be in conversation with Leena Kim, with a book signing to follow, at Barnes & Noble at 765 Route 17 South in Paramus, NJ on Saturday, March 4th at 2:00pm. For more information, click here.
