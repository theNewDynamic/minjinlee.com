reviews:
  - attribution: 'Kate Christensen, Pen/Faulkner-winning author of *The Great Man* and *Blue Plate Special*'
    copy_markdown: "*Pachinko* is elegant and soulful, both intimate and sweeping. This story of several generations of one Korean family in Japan is the story of every family whose parents sacrificed for their children, every family whose children were unable to recognize the cost, but it's also the story of a specific cultural struggle in a riveting time and place. Min Jin Lee has written a big, beautiful book filled with characters I rooted for and cared about and remembered after I'd read the final page."
  - attribution: 'David Mitchell, New York Times bestselling author of *The Bone Clocks*, *Cloud Atlas*, and *Black Swan Green*'
    copy_markdown: 'A deep, broad, addictive history of a Korean family in Japan enduring and prospering through the 20th century.'
  - attribution: 'Gary Shteyngart, New York Times bestselling author of *Little Failure* and *Super Sad True Love Story*'
    copy_markdown: "Astounding. The sweep of Dickens and Tolstoy applied to a 20th century Korean family in Japan. Min Jin Lee's *Pachinko* tackles all the stuff most good novels do—family, love, cabbage—but it also asks questions that have never been more timely. What does it mean to be part of a nation? And what can one do to escape its tight, painful, familiar bonds?"
  - attribution: "Erica Wagner, author of *Ariel's Gift* and *Seizure*"
    copy_markdown: "If proof were needed that one family's story can be the story of the whole world, then *Pachinko* offers that proof. Min Jin Lee's novel is gripping from start to finish, crossing cultures and generations with breathtaking power. *Pachinko* is a stunning achievement, full of heart, full of grace, full of truth."
  - attribution: 'Darin Strauss, National Book Critics Circle Award-winning author of *Half a Life* and *Chang & Eng*'
    copy_markdown: 'Pachinko by Min Jin Lee is a great book, a passionate story, a novel of magisterial sweep. It’s also fiendishly readable—the real deal. An instant classic, a quick page-turner, and probably the best book of the year.'
  - attribution: 'Simon Winchester, New York Times bestselling author of *The Professor and the Madman* and *Korea: A Walk through the Land of Miracles*'
    copy_markdown: 'Both for those who love Korea, as well as for those who know no more than Hyundai, Samsung and kimchi, this extraordinary book will prove a revelation of joy and heartbreak. I could not stop turning the pages, and wished this most poignant of sagas would never end. Min Jin Lee displays a tenderness and wisdom ideally matched to an unforgettable tale that she relates just perfectly.'
  - attribution: _Kirkus_ (Starred Review)
    copy_markdown: 'Deeply compelling story. An old-fashioned epic whose simple, captivating storytelling delivers both wisdom and truth.'
  - attribution: _Library Journal_ (Starred Review)
    copy_markdown: 'A beautifully crafted story of love, loss, determination, luck, and perseverance.'

PACHINKO follows one Korean family through the generations, beginning in early 1900s Korea with Sunja, the prized daughter of a poor yet proud family, whose unplanned pregnancy threatens to shame them all. Deserted by her lover, Sunja is saved when a young tubercular minister offers to marry and bring her to Japan.

So begins a sweeping saga of an exceptional family in exile from its homeland and caught in the indifferent arc of history. Through desperate struggles and hard-won triumphs, its members are bound together by deep roots as they face enduring questions of faith, family, and identity.
